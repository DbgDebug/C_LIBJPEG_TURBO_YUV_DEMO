# libjpeg-turbo & YUV

yuv_test.c and yuv_test.h demonstrate how to apply libjpeg-turbo in compressing a YUV (YUV444P or YUV420P) frame into a jpg file and also decompressing a jpg file into a YUV frame.

tj_test.h and tj_test.c are copied from [here](https://blog.csdn.net/subfate/article/details/46794639). These codes show how to compress a RGB frame into a jpg file and decompress a jpg file into a RGB frame. They help me learn libjpeg-turbo. 

This project is tested on Windows 10. The version of the library files are 1.5.1-gcc64.
